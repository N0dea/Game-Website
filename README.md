# Game-Website
Videogame forum website made from scratch. 
This website was designed in Illustrator and programmed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL. 
A final project for my Web Development class, I designed this website to cater to gamers who are 
interested in all aspects of games: news, reviews, opinion pieces, and et cetera.

There is a home page, "My Faves", which pulls from a database, and "The Latest", which displays a few upcoming games.
